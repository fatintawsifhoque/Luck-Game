# 🎲 Luck Game

A turn-based luck game built with **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — where players take turns clicking their button to increase their score, and the first to reach the target wins!  

This project was built to practice **DOM manipulation, event handling, game logic, and modern UI design** — all from scratch, without any frameworks.
